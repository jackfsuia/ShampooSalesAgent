## Updates
- An proactive, experimental version is [Proactive-Sales-Agent](https://github.com/jackfsuia/Proactive-Sales-Agent).
## Quick Start
Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackfsuia/ShampooSalesAgent.git && cd ShampooSalesAgent
```
After installing the requirements (gradio, openai, etc). Run

```bash
python start.py MODEL YOUR_KEY
```
MODEL can be [gpt3.5/4](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview), [claude](https://www.anthropic.com/api), [gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key), [baichuan](https://platform.baichuan-ai.com/console/apikey), [qwen](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/dashscope/developer-reference/activate-dashscope-and-create-an-api-key), [kimi](https://platform.moonshot.cn/console/api-keys), [glm](https://open.bigmodel.cn/usercenter/apikeys), [deepseek](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys).YOUR_KEY is your model API KEY. If you don't have a KEY, click the link on those model names to apply/buy.

But if you're using [ernie](https://cloud.baidu.com/doc/WENXINWORKSHOP/s/clntwmv7t), you should instead run 
```bash
python start.py MODEL API_Key Secret_Key
```
API_Key and Secret_Key are defined by ernie, please refer to their website.

and if you're using [huggingface model](https://huggingface.co/welcome), just run 
```bash
python start.py MODEL
```
That's all!  

If you want to use CLI instead of web as interface, just use `start_CLI.py` instead of `start.py`.

By default, this agent proactively sells Shampoo. Write your own product information to [product_description](product_description) if you want to sell something else. The order infomation (name, address, phone number, purchase quantity, etc. provided by customers)  will be printed to [customer_orders.csv](customer_orders.csv). The mission prompt is in [normal_flow.py](chat_flow/normal_flow.py) in case you want to change it.

## Examples
Let's say you're using gpt-3.5-turbo as model, the KEY you bought is sdjkSOIjkdejs. Then you should be running
```bash
python start.py gpt-3.5-turbo sdjkSOIjkdejs
```
or for short ([a few models have short names](#Table))
```bash
python start.py gpt sdjkSOIjkdejs
```
*For [gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) on Windows 10 to successfully work, you might have to download some mystery file that you have to turn off Windows Defender and add some folders to Defender exclusion list to do.*

then the ouput will be something like this
```
path\ShampooSalesAgent>python start.py gpt sdjkSOIjkdejs

## Model Evaluation—Who is the Sales Champion?

Run 
```bash
python order_counting.py
```
you will find out. You can share your interesting results on this benchmark with us all.

## Future Work
- Finetune the model to be more professional at selling things, and talk more natural just like human. It is important to make people feel connections with each other, even with a robot (like the movie, *her*). 99% of people are not complex reasoning machines, but almost every one of them can make us feel warm and support at some point in life.
- Support multimodal models. This might be simpler and soon.
